# How to start with MjolNear?

### Which contracts are supported on MjolNear?

Not every contract on NEAR blockchain is NFT contract. There are several standarts that must be implemented by the contract: [NEP-171](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Core), [NEP-177](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Metadata), [NEP-178](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/ApprovalManagement) and  [NEP-181](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Enumeration). If contract implements all this standarts, it will become visible on MjolNear and any NFT from this contract can be sold or bought via MjolNear.

### What if I want to create my own NFT contract?

It seems a bit complex on the first look but MjolNear team will provide a complex exmaple on how to create your own NFT contract that will satisfy all the requirements, described in previous section.
